HelicalChain
============
The HelicalChain class provides a class definition for a generation of unit
cells with inclusions distributed in a helical chain. The class inherits from
the InclusionRVE class and extends it in order to specify the remaining
placeholder methods of the GenericModel.

Currently, the class is restricted to circular and spherical inclusions which
are arranged in a helical chain that is parallel to one of the coordinate axes.
